list_neighbors.py creates a list of neighbors for each polygon in a given shapefile

geo-mapping.r creates a list of nested geographies (like what block groups are inside a given tract, what blocks are inside a block group) 
and also the reverse (which block group is a block in, which tract is a block group in)

.Rdata contains some helpful temp files

.Rhistory has some console commands that I used to write to files (instead of lines of body code)
